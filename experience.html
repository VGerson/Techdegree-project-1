        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have worked in the transportation and logistics industry for several years now. I have exposed myself to several aspects of the logistics industry to learn more about it.</p>
        <p>First I started as a Hot Shot Truck Driver for a small auto transport company. I transported all kinds of vehicles from and to auto auctions, dealerships and private owners. I Learned how yo use and ELD and became knowledgeable about DOT regulations. As a driver, I was exposed to many different problems that happen over the road. Flat tire, mechanical break down and equipment malfunction. These are things that can greatly impact the flow of goods, driver HOS or hours of service, and can be the differnce between goods delivering late or in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>Using my knowledge from being a Hot Shot Truck Driver I was able to become a Custome Experence Rep for a big carrier. Where I was able to learn more about what happens behind the scence of the transportation world. At this postion I managed dry, refrigerated, frozen and salvage loads. I also managed pickup and delivery appointments for each load, dealt with any issues that would come up regarding a certain load and monitored every shipment to make sure it picked up and delivered on time. All these while working with other teams regarding pricing, customer accounts and other general inquiries related to the transportation of goods for our customer.</p>
        <p>Now I work as a shipping and Receiving manager for a small company in Arkanasas. I manage all the shipping and receipt of all products, materials and supplies. I work with different carrier partners to decide what is the most efficient and cost effective way to ship a certain shipment. We ship via Parcel Ground and Express services as well as LTL and truckload. I am in charge of arranging pickup and delivery appointments and/or provide detailed instructions regarding pikcup and/or delivery of goods.</p>
