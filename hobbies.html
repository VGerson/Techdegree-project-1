        <h2>Learning New Things</h2>
        <p>Learning new things has always been a hobbie of mine since I was a little kid. Everytime I see something that is interesting to me, I want to elarn how to do or learn more about it.</p>
        <p>Most recent "thing" I started learning would be web development. Back in 2019 I was exposed to coding and it really caught my attention. I wanted to learn more about it and be good at it, but that quickly changed after my first week in my intro to computer science class using C++.</p>
        <p>As a nood in the coding world, I didnt know about coding languages or the difference between them. I then later found out that the coding language we were using in that class was one of the hardest laguages to learn or to start coding when you're a biginner. Passed the class with an average score but wanted nothing to do with programming after that until years later that I found web development which led to learn at Treehouse.</p>

        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>Reading was not always a fun thing to do for me. I used to find it boring and just to think about sitting for a long period of time reading something was not apealing to me.</p>
        <p>Just like how I stumbled back into learning how to code, I learned that I do read fair amounts of content online throughout the day without realizing. The trick is to read short articles that I find interesting and relevant. Some topics that would catch my attention would be Politics, Personal Finance and Tech.</p>
        <p>I cant mention any books because I have yet to read a book from start to finish. I guess for me, reading is about learning things I find interesting. I cant sit down for a long period of time reading just for entertainment. I would much rather watch a documentary.</p>

        <h2>Physical Activities</h2>
        <p>Physical activiy is important for the human body. Like my desire to learn new things I also like to try new ways to stay active. Sometimes going to the gym for a long period of time is not for everyone and can interfere with your productive lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Back when I was a teenager I used to run marathons. I was in the Track/Cross Country team at my school. Never approcahed it with a competitive mindset. I just wanted to stay active and get a good grade. Througout the years I have tried different activities to keep me active but never stock to one in particular. As I was growing up and trying to embrace the adulthood and lifestyle I have had the need to find new activities to stay active that work well with my current squedule and lifestyle.</p>
        <p>At the moment I am trying a new activity that is practical, anyone can do and you dont need expensive equipment. That is Jumping Rope. I have known about jumping rope since I was a kid, but never considered it a real form of exercise. One time I was reading an article about the benefits of jumping rope everyday. Altough every form of physical activity comes with pros and cons, jumping rope works for me at the moment. </p>
